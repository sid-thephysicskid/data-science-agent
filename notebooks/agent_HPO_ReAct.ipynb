    "# Hyperparameter Optimization with ReAct agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore how to use LangChain to create an intelligent agent for hyperparameter optimization. The agent will iteratively suggest hyperparameters, evaluate their performance, and log the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Imports and Configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by importing the necessary libraries and configurations. This includes data processing libraries like `pandas`, machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`, and configuration variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Define Pydantic Models\n",
    "\n",
    "We define Pydantic models for our hyperparameters and analysis. This ensures that our inputs and outputs are well-structured and validated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Define the Training Function\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a function to train a Random Forest model using the specified hyperparameters. This function loads the dataset, preprocesses it, trains the model, and evaluates it using the AUC metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Initialize Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialize the tools that our agent will use, including the `train_random_forest` function and a file-writing tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Create the Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "We create the agent by defining a detailed prompt template and binding the LLM with the tools. The prompt guides the agent through the hyperparameter optimization process, including logging each iteration and providing a final summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Initialize the LLM and Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialize the LLM with streaming enabled and create the agent using our previously defined function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Execute the Agent and Stream the Output\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialize the `AgentExecutor`, define the input task, and execute the agent, streaming the output for real-time feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to create an intelligent agent for hyperparameter optimization using LangChain. By following these steps, you can create an agent that iteratively improves model performance and logs the results for further analysis.\n"
