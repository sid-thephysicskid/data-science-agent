- Adjusted set 7: AUC = 0.9160

Thought Process and Parameter Impact:
- Initially, increasing `n_estimators` and `max_depth` showed improvement.
- Further increasing these parameters beyond a certain point did not yield significant improvements and sometimes even decreased the AUC score.
- Finding a balance between `min_samples_split` and `min_samples_leaf` was crucial for achieving a stable and improved AUC.
- The final set of hyperparameters provided the best balance between model complexity and performance.

Analysis:
- Effective: Moderate increases in `n_estimators` and `max_depth` improved the model's ability to capture complexity.
- Not Effective: Excessive increases in these parameters led to diminishing returns and sometimes overfitting.
- Balancing `min_samples_split` and `min_samples_leaf` was critical to prevent overfitting while capturing sufficient patterns in the data.
